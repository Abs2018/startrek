Vulcan,"Vulcans were the first alien species encountered by Humans that were significantly different in physiology and psychology from people of Terra. They are Human-like in many respects, but in other ways they are totally different.\r\nThe name of their home planet, as translated from their tongue, is Vulcan. It is a harsh world, dry and hot, with higher gravity and a thinner atmosphere than Terra. These conditions affected the Vulcan physical development. Vulcans are stronger than Humans, with more physical endurance. Their blood chemistry is based on copper (rather than iron) as a carrier of oxygen. This makes their blood greenish in color, and gives them a somewhat greenish-yellow complexion. Their eyes are protected from the harsh Vulcan winds and sand by a thin transparent membrane, much like a second eyelid.",20,10,10,0,0,-40,0,1,1
