Human,"There are more Humans than any other species in the Federation. Besides Humans born on Terra (Earth), there are those from thousands of Human colony worlds. On some of these worlds, particularly those that have been colonized for a long time, the Human population has evolved to better adapt to local conditions.\r\nBesides Terran colonies, there are a number of civilizations with no known ties to Terra that have nevertheless produced native species identical to Humans from Terra in virtually all respects. Scientists have not answered the questions this raises, nor have they explained why even some definitely non-Human races (Vulcans and Klingons, to name only two) still bear so many resemblances to Humans. It is believed by some scientists that ALL humanoid races are offshoots from some common space-travelling race in the far distant past. This theory is not proven, however, and is widely disputed.\r\nAll planetary cultures with basically Human physiology are considered as Human, despite unimportant variations in height, weight, skin coloration, sensory enhancement, or other superficial differences. In every attribute but Psionic Potential, the Human race is used to define the average. Humans have very low Psionic Potential, but they are the luckiest of the races.\r\nThough all Humans have basically the same physical characteristics, their motivations and backgrounds may be very different. Not all Human cultures are part of the Federation, some may even be its enemies.",0,0,0,0,0,0,-30,1,1
