1. Set classes of ships.

The purpose of this will be to change the menus. For example, on a small ship, you are the only crew, so you control everything from scanning, to piloting, to repair. On a larger ship, you will have crew, so you just give the orders. Also, crew should be able to speak and provide opinions on tasks.

Ship class sizes:

- X-Small: shuttle, escape pod
- Small: Scout
- Medium: Reliant,
- Large: 
- X-Large: Constitution, Federation

Ships will have a maximum tonnage that the equipment can add up to. If passing this tonnage, the ship's structural integrity field will not hold.

2. Ship equipment classes.
	- Not able to scan as far
	- Takes longer to warp
	- Scans don't show everything

3. Ship systems. The systems should be able to be damaged. As they become more damaged, you will lose more crew, which results in less efficiency.
